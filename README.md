# Assignment-3
Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python

Overview
This assignment consists of two Python scripts, each demonstrating fundamental programming concepts:

Task 1: Calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.

Task 2: Performs various mathematical calculations using the built-in math module.

Task 1: Factorial Calculation (Assignment3Task1.py)
This script calculates the factorial of an integer provided by the user.

The program prompts the user to input a number.

It defines a recursive function, factorial(n), that calculates the factorial according to the mathematical definition:

The factorial of the entered number is computed and displayed with a descriptive message.

Example Output
text
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is : 120
Task 2: Math Module Calculations (Assignment3Task2.py)
This script uses the Python math module to perform several calculations for a user-provided number.

The program prompts the user for an integer input.

It defines a function fn(n) that:

Calculates and prints the square root of the number.

Calculates and prints the natural logarithm (base e) of the number.

Calculates and prints the sine of the number (after converting degrees to radians).

The function displays the outputs with labels for clarity.
